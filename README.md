# CA3
* First we made a repository, named CA3
* Next I created a file `test.txt`, with contents "blank for now" in my main branch, and committed.
* Next I created a new branch of the repo, named `branch1`.
* Next I modified file `text.txt`, with new contents "now I have made some changes", and committed this to the new branch
* Finally, I created this `README.md` file and committed it to the new `branch1`
